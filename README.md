# Phytophthora-sansomeana-host-range-and-fungicide-sensitivity
Code and data for the P. sansomeana host range / fungicide sensitivity characterization

File information
### Host Phenotype
"combined runs.xlsx" - phenotypic data from growth chamber experiments

### Oomicide sensitivity testing
"psanso.r1andr2combined.gooddata.xlsx" - calculated relative and absolute EC50 values, BLANK optical densities, mean isolate optical density, and z'-factor values for each isolate

### _P.sansomeana_ quantification within root tissue, qPCR results files
"samples xx-xx psanso host root dna - Quantification Summary.xlsx" - These files contain samples 1-252 qPCR results that were used for analysis
"psanso randoms redos host range root dna - Quantification Summary.xlsx" - samples that needed redone initially due to poor amplification/questionable results initially
"psanso rerun of 8 samples - Quantification Summary.xlsx" final 8 samples that needed rerun to confirm results and complete dataset
"All sansomeana qPCR data standardized baseline.xlsx" - all of the above files combined. The fluorophore baseline for all samples was set the same across plates so that Ct values would be comparable.

### Data Analysis
"psanso figures for publication.Rmd" - This file contains all analysis code and figure production code for this project. The above files will be needed to run this code in its entirety and are loaded in at the beginning of this code chunk.
